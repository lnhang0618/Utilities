# Scientific Plotting Repository

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to scientific plotting, primarily focusing on the visualization of data and results in various scientific domains. It is structured into different folders, each serving a specific purpose and utilizing the `sciplotlib` library for plotting.

### sciplotlib

The `sciplotlib` directory contains the core plotting functionalities encapsulated in a library. It's designed to simplify and standardize the process of creating academic-level plots. For detailed information, please refer to the README in the `sciplotlib` directory: [sciplotlib/README.md](./sciplotlib/README.md).

### DAFOAM

The `dafoam` folder is tailored for post-processing fluid dynamics data. Utilizing the `sciplotlib` library, it aids in visualizing and analyzing data generated by DAFOAM simulations. For more details, check the README in the `dafoam` directory: [dafoam/README.md](./dafoam/README.md).

### LLM

The `LLM` directory is designed for post-processing large language models (LLM) structures and data using the `sciplotlib` library. This facilitates the understanding and analysis of complex language model behaviors and patterns. For further information, please see the README in the `LLM` directory: [LLM/README.md](./LLM/README.md).
